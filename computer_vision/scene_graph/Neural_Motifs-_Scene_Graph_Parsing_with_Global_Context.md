# Neural Motifs: Scene Graph Parsing with Global Context
[link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.06640.pdf)

**useful analysis to Visual Genome statistics**

## Intro 

- motifs: regulary appearing substructures in scene graphs 
- key is to encode global context that can directly inform the local predictors 
- Visual Genome, predominant relations are geometric and possessive 
- use bidirectional LSTM to produce global contexts
