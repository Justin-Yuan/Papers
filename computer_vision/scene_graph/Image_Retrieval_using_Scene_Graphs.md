# Image Retrieval using Scene Graphs
[link](https://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2015/scenegraphs/JohnsonCVPR2015.pdf)

## Intro 

- conditional random field (CRF), likelihoods of groundings used as ranking scores for retrieval
- detailed semantics: objects, attributes, relationships 
-  Replacing textual queries with scene graphs allows queries to describe the semantics of the desired image in precise detail without relying on unstructured text
- scene graph and scene graph grounding 
- need to measure the agreement between a query scene graph and an unannotated test image
