# Generating Semantically Precise Scene Graphs from Textual Descriptions for Improved Image Retrieval
[link](http://anthology.aclweb.org/W/W15/W15-2812.pdf)

## Intro 

- parse scene description to scene graph
- Including relations and attributes in the query graph outperforms a model that only considers objects 
- parsing to scene graphs can be used to generate 3D scenes 
- parse image description to dependency trees to produce semantic graph
