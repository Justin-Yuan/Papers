Probabilistic Logic Neural Networks for Reasoning
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08495.pdf>

- knowledge graph reasoning, aims at predicting missing facts through reasoning with observed facts
- traditional approach is rule-based, recent approach is knowledge graph embedding (TransE, DistMult)
- Markov Logic Network (MLN) leverge domain knowledge with first-order logic and handle uncertainty
- probabilistic Logic Neural Network (pLogicNet), learn effective entity and relation embeddings + leverage domain knowledge; defines joint distribution of all possible triplets by MLN, optimize with variational EM

Provably Convergent Off-Policy Actor-Critic with Function Approximation
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.04384.pdf>

- provably convergent off-policy actor-critic algo (COF-PAC) with function approximation in a two-timescale form 
- emphasis critic, trained with Gradient Emphasis Learning (GEM), which is a combination of Gradient Temporal Difference Learning and Emphatic Temporal Difference Learning
- critics are linear but actor can be non-linear
