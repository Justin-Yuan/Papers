Neural Similarity Learning
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13003.pdf>

- generalize inner product convolution to bilinear matrix 
- neural similarity learning (NSL), static NSL & dynamic NSL 
- by regularizing the bilinear matrix, NSL learns the shape of kernel and the similarity matrix simultaneously

Image-Conditioned Graph Generation for Road Network Extraction
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.14388.pdf>
code: <https://github.com/davide-belli/generative-graph-transformer>
<https://github.com/davide-belli/toulouse-road-network-dataset>

- road network extraction from image data, framed as image-conditioned graph generation 
- Generative Graph Transformer (GGT), deep autoregressive model with attention, recurrent generation of graphs 
- introduce Toulouse Road Network dataset 
- propose streetMover distance, based on Sinkhorn distance (between point clouds) to evaluate quality of road network generation, invariant with respect to node permutation, graph translation and rotation

A Prior of a Googol Gaussians: a Tensor Ring Induced Prior for Generative Models
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13148.pdf>

- GAN and VAE mostly use a standard Gaussian prior, but richer prior can help prevent mode collapse in GAN and improve evidence lower bound in VAE 
- propose new family of distributions: Tensor Ring Induced Prior (TRIP), packs an exponential number of Gaussians in a high-dimensional lattice with relatively small number of parameters 
- apply to conditional generation, show to improve FID for GAN and ELBO for VAE
