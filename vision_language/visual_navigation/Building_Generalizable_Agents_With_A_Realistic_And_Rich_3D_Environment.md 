#  Building Generalizable Agents With A Realistic And Rich 3D Environment 
[link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.02209.pdf)

## Intro

- sourced from **SUNCG Dataset** 
- Facebook House3D Environment, targeted navigation 
- include a table to compare different simulation environments 
- high throughput rendering 
- concept-driven navigation 
- multi-target learning problem 

## Modeling 

- visual input: raw pixels, semantic segmentation mask, depth information 
- rewards: collision penalty with obstacles, task success reward 
- informative reward shaping: approximate shortest distance from target room to agent location 
- gated-CNN + DDPG (continuous action) & gated-LSTM + A3C (discrete action)
- gated fusion module to use target semantic embedding (interpreted as an attention mechanism)
- augmentation
    - pixel-level, domain randomization 
    - task-level, auxiliary targets 
    - scene-level, more diverse houses 

## Evaluation

- metric: agent in the target room & consecutively see the designated object 

## Future Work 

- generalization to unseen environments
