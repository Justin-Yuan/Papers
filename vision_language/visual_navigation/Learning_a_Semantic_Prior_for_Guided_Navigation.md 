# Learning a Semantic Prior for Guided Navigation 
[link](https://eccv18-vlease.github.io/static/papers/learning-a-semantic-prior.pdf), also **Learning and Planning with a Semantic Model**

#### **Need more careful read**

## Intro 

- assume some low-dimensional discrete semantic signals from perceptino is available 
- learn a Bayesian model over the semantic structures to provide exploration guidances for subpolicies 
    - structured prior over semantics of the environment 
    - efficient inference and planning 
    - interpretable 
- structural similarities between environments that can be captured as a probabilistic graphical model over the semantic information 

## Modeling 

- contextual Markov Decision Process 
- model as a probabilisticgraph ovear targets

## Evaluation 

- RoomNav task
