# Emergent Behaviors workshop

### Summary

- emergent behavior as by-product or the objective ?
- when interacting with humans, having emergent behaviors on the human side
- emergent behaviors could be a tool to solve problems cannot be solved otherwise
- what sort of signals should be adapted to the humans ?
    - can you query the person ?
    - different supervision signal from interaction will determine the sort of algorithms to use
- comes down to what we think the kinds of state-action abstraction are
- breaking the symmetry of coordination might be better
    - more for full state setting, partial state might be hard
- multiple time scales
- using emergent behaviors out in the wild in the factories
- more realistic modeling of humans when necessary
    - a person is not just a robot
- being transparent to what and why we are using emergent behaviors
    - what kind of optimization processes and objectives leads to human capabilities
    - doing it in a more task-agnostic way
- pushing the frontier of task complexity
