# Transfer learning

---

## Plan Forward

- check out siqi & michael works
- follow their thinkong on robust control, so need to learn robust control ?
- meta-learning with fast adaptation
- Bayesian RL for quick adaptation
- causal RL ??? not sure
- catch up on recent works for sim2real robotics
- imgrate work on own repo (with python and c++, matlab too?)
