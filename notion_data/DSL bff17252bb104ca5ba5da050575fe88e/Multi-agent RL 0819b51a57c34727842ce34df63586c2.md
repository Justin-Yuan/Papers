# Multi-agent RL

---

## Plan Forward

- finish mas book
- learn about distributional mpc
- learn about distributional optimization
- catch up on recent marl works
- migrate existing marl SOTA to own repo or check out pymarl
- learn game theory
- study line of work from deepmind
- think about tools to use for analyzing multi-agent learning dynamics
    - may need to learn theoretica RL too
