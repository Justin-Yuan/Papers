### Experience Selection Using Dynamics Similarity for Efficient Multi-Source Transfer Learning Between Robots

link: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13150](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13150)

summary 

- system gap metric from robust contorl theory, v-gap
- transfer an inverse dynamics model
- task: target quadrotor hand-drawn trajectories
- assume robot is minimum-phase
- parameterize inverse dynamics model as GP, use source robot as prior
- physical meaning and intuition about v-gap ?
- why use max across n systesm for next sample point (frequency) of the BO procedures

thoughts

- berkeley's paper on using meta learning with quads
- paper on using different sources of off-policy samples without knowing them during training
- system gap connect with posterior samplig in RL ?
- use system gap with linear control for non-linear control sounds like a projection and find best policy on the projected space
- connectoin to few-shot learning
    - sanja's paper on quantifying few-shot trials
- re-using non-similar robot dynamics
    - weighting ?
- dont need a exact similarity measure but just model ranking
    - save space and time ?
- v-gap originally only for linear systems, how to tackle non-linear ones ?

### To Share or Not to Share? Performance Guarantees and the Asymmetric Nature of Cross-Robot Experience Transfer

link: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16126](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16126)

summary 

- theoretical bound for robot experience transfer
- interesting asymmetric transfer property
- why second term denominator represent aggressiveness of system, what does the cordinal distance to 0 represent intuitively ?
- and how about numerator, what does it mean for another system ?

thoughts 

- connection to random fourier features ?
- connection with SIREN paper ?
- the balance of the transfer with the decomposition scheme seems interesting

### Knowledge Transfer Between Robots with Similar Dynamics for High-Accuracy Impromptu Trajectory Tracking

link: [http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00249](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00249)

summary 

- use offline-learned DNN from source model with a online-learning model to do correction for test time adaptation, kinda like meta-learning

thoughts 

- transfer learning on RL with policy distillation → but model-based ?
- impromptu knowledge transfer → few shot RL ?

### Multi-Robot Transfer Learning: A Dynamical System Perspective

link: [http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08689](http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08689)

summary 

- optimal transfer map
- the transfer map is a dynamics system instead of being static
- one typical way to do transfer learning is manifold alignment → align datasets

thoughts 

- connect to optimal transport in probability ?
    - dynamical system connect to MDP distribution ?
- might related to MDP homomorphisms (if treat dynamic model as MDP)
