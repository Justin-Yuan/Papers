# Meeting notes

### Paper discussion

- nonlinear control with v-gap
- why tossing out unselected candidate experience/inverse model
    - could dynamically use different model to align ?
    - something related to mpc, linearize at different regions, but might be unstable
    - other type of system gap metrics ?
        - v-gap is less conservative, also  related to frequency metric
        - the decomposition scheme for symmetry
            - fast system transfer to slow system would be beneficial
- necessary to have hard score to rank model ?
    - maybe just a soft ranking → ends up still require a score
    - pairwise comparison is inefficient
- why acquisition take max among source models
    - reduce sampling time for target system (shared with all source models for each similarity score estimate)
- meta-learning
- leraning transfer-map
    - L1 adpative control
    - enforce system to behave a predefine manner
    - pros: know it's linear, transfer that would also be linear, will also generalize if the operating region is outside of the range
    - depends on what is fixed and what is learnable
    - related to model reference adaptive control

### Potential research direction

- multi-agent + transfer learning
    - teams of robot transfer to another team of robots
    - group of agents stack into a big system
        - useful structure to use for the gap metric → factorization
    - distributed mpc
        - agents knows plans of the other ones
        - knows exact position or desired position or predicted path
            - desired path is better
        - no learning involved just optimization
- minimal next step
    - read the robust control book
    - quadrotor simulation environment
    - nonlinear control note / course in DSL drive

### Courses
