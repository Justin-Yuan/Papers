### Finding the Right Problem

- key idea: maintain a single master document on research ideas

### Managing Papers

- key idea: use Papers app, organize papers with (hierarchical) tags and re-organize once in a while

### Managing a Project

- key idea: use one github repo per project, collect all write-ups and code

### Managing Experiments

- key idea: sync local work with server, ssh with tmux and run in server

![Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%204.png](Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%204.png)

- set up hyperparameters options

![Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%205.png](Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%205.png)

- experiment outputs

![Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%206.png](Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%206.png)

### Exploration, Debugging, & Diagnostics

- key idea: use Tensorboard for logging, use print statements for debugging (but terrible)

![Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%207.png](Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%207.png)

### Improving Research Understanding

- key idea: interrogate your model, algorithm and iterate

## Better Saving and Logging for Research Experiments

link: [https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2018/12/17/better-logging/](https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2018/12/17/better-logging/) 

- use version control

![Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%209.png](Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%209.png)

- use argparse for hyperparameter tuning

![Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%2010.png](Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%2010.png)

![Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%2011.png](Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%2011.png)

- save the results from experiment runs in unique directories
- how to name experiment folders

![Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%2012.png](Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%2012.png)

- reproducibility, attach output generating command to write-ups

![Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%2013.png](Workflow%2065c64bd8929149918ee6c85a38fdcb5d/Untitled%2013.png)

## My Thoughts & Summaries

### How to start researching a field ?

- Day 1: collect resources and read introduction materials
- Day 2: go over all materials and take rough notes
- Day 3: organize notes and clear anything unclear
- Day 4: go over implementations or engineering details
- Day 5: practice with small experiments
- Day 6: start thinking about extensions and potentials
- Day 7: reflect and plan for next stage

---

### How to read a paper ?

- determine if a paper is worth reading → if not, stage 1 paper
    1. read full title & abstract
    2. read introduction and conclusion 
    3. glance through figures and tables
- paper is worth, get a grasp of the general content, determine if the paper is worth documenting, go for basic notes (draft notes) → stage 2 paper
    1. read background 
    2. glance through methodology 
    3. read and make sense of experiments 
- paper is relevant and useful, take careful notes (refined notes), apply critical thinking on the paper, and squeeze all the good stuff out of it → stage 3 paper
    1. carefully go over methodology
    2. critic experiments    
    3. think about pros, cons and extensions

### How to organize Zotero ?

- zotero folder structures
    - "A-" folders are temporary folders, require immediate actions
    - "B-" folders are central collection folders, stores categorized, read papers
    - "C-" folders are project folders, stores (secondary-)collection of papers for each project
    - "Misc" folder stores paper of specific topics, can later be moved to "B-" folders
    - "Tablet-" stores papers sent to iPad for reading
    - "Group Libraries" stores paper collections for shared use
- zotero tags
    - paper importance: 1-relevant, 2-useful, 3-important, 4-essential
    - paper usage: 5-literature, 6-experiment, 7-writing
    - paper required action: 8-revisit, 9-unread

---

### How to use Zotero for paper reading ?

- use browser plugin to collect papers
    1. use folder "A-today" for new found reads 
    2. use folder "A-unread" for pending reads
    3. after reading & notes, add tags, add relevants, organize into "B-" folders (and "C-" folders if already know useful for a project) 
- desktop/laptop reading
    - Okular for Linux
        - ctrl+4 for text selection, F6 for annotation mode, 1 for highlight, 2 for note, ctrl+shift+s for saving overwrite (must do, otherwise annotations are saved separately somewhere else)
    - Preview for Mac
- mobile reading
    - PaperShip
    - PDF Viewer, Dropbox sync and zotfile ("send to tablet" option)

---

### How to use Notion for paper note taking ?

- stage 1 paper → only use highlights and built-in text notes on original pdf
- stage 2 & 3 paper
    - use Notion "Papers" database to save notes
    - add tags, including topic, read/unread, importance, etc
    - add brief summary (easier to navigate from "Papers" page view)
    - add filters and new view (correspond to topic) if necessary
- on specific topics
    - categorize in "Knowledge base/Academia"
    - each category is "major class : subclass"
    - try to use flat structure for each resource (blog, pdf, etc), use sub-page if necessary
    - use links to papers, if in Notion "Papers" database, link to database note page; otherwise, use URL link with a brief summary
    - put any further references (unread or need to revisit) in "References" section in topic page
- on specific book
    - categorize in "Knowledge base/Books"
- on specific course
    - categorize in "Knowledge base/Courses"

### How to do daily research work ?

- assume normal work hours are 12pm - 6pm and 8pm - 2am, total 12h
- 80-20 rule: work on sides for 12 * 0.2 = 2.4h (20%)
- keep up-to-date: check news and feeds for 12 * 0.1 = 1.2h (10%)
- study courses/skills: learning sessions for 12 * 0.2 = 2.4h (20%)
- heavy research: concentrated periods for 12 * 0.5 = 6h (50%)
- detailed plan
    - wake up early (6~7h)
    - administrative work (before 12)
    - check news (1.2h)
    - study (1.2h)
    - research (3h)
    - study (1.2h)
    - research (3h)
    - sides (2.4h)
    - sleep (before 3am)
- rest time: anime, managa, game + work out
