Bird's exfoliater (not N7)

am mosturizer: Neutrogena 

night cream: burk bee's 

eye cream: 

anti-aging: Neutrogena (rapid wrinkle repair) 

Face wash - Men's Dove + Care Face Wash: nice product that's mild in terms of the scent, it foams but not too sudsy. It doesn't leave your face too dry. It's $5 for 5 ounces.
Exfoliating Scrub - Burt's Bees Deep Pore Scrub: use peach or apricot seeds (big pieces) as the exfoliator, it's unscented, and it washes off cleaner. $10 was the cost.
AM Moisturizer - Keep in mind that an AM moisturizer contains an SPF. Alpha itemizes the products he didn't like and why. But the winner for this category was Neutrogena Age Fighter. This stuff was $13 for 1.4 ounces, SPF 15, and with no scent.
PM Moisturizer - Not many men's night creams are on the market in drug store brands. Burt's Bees Intense Hydration is thick with a neutral scent. The price is $10.
Eye Cream - This product is essential to fight crows feet and dark circles. Alpha chose Oil of Olay Regenerist, which is a superior product. The cost $50 for .5 ounce.
Anti-aging Serum - This product fights wrinkles with retinol. Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair is Alpha's choice for this category. The cost is $22.
