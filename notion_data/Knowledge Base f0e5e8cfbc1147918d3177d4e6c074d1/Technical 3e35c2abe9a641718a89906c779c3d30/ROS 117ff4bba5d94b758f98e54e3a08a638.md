## useful ROS tools

[10 Useful ROS Tools - ROS Guru](https://ros.guru/2018/02/12/10-useful-ros-tools/#more-98)

- use rqt_console for debugging, filtering messages
- rqt_logger_level, mark debug messages
- rqt_launchtree, show and compare (nested) launch files
- rqt, build a quick-and-dirty control panel or status window for your robot. (can even add an RViz window or web browser as a panel.)

- The message thief will create shadow packages on your own machine that match those that are published by other machines on the ROS system. This will allow you to actually work with those previously unknown messages
- Status Panel, this RViz display sits at the bottom or top of your RViz window and neatly displays String messages that are published to a certain topic
- RViz Visual Tools, contains all the RViz markers, also contains tools for stepping through a debugger straight from RViz.

- rosnode
    - rosnode info <node_name> to get a list of a node’s subscribed topics, advertised topics, and services
    - rosnode list
    - rosnode kill
- rqt_top, performs a similar function to the top command in the Linux terminal, showing what system resources each running node is currently using.
- roswtf, debugging complex ROS-specific issues, such as two nodes that aren’t communicating with each other, two nodes publishing to the same topic, or issues with your TF tree.
