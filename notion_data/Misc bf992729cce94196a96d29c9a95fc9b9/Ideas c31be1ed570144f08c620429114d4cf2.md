---

combine zemel’s work on graphi structural inference with shaman’s work on factored value function

---

causal rl 

---

DAgger and active learning ? 

---

multi-agent with gnn ? 

---

learn metric

---

theoretical rl 

---

multi-agent rl dynamics (with game theoretical perspective) 

e.g. mechanics of n-player differentiable games

---

conection between neural processes and few-shot learning ?

seen from code ? 

and use NP to replace GP in safe learning ?

---

neural episodic control uses a differentiable dictionary, could combine with constrastive momentum dictionary learning ? 

---

interplay among distributed system, distributed learning, multi-agent learning and RL ?

---

 add in learning component in controller for adversarial perturbations  ?

- how to do other-play without knowing symmetry ?
- learning to communicate through actions requires to infer other’s policies which is exponential in self-play
- use other-play in emergent communication problems ?
- stochastic control under multi-agent setting ?
- fully cooperative and partial information qardrant
