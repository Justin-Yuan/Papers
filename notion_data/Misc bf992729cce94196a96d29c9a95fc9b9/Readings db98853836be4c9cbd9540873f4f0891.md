### Model-Based Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Flight with Suspended Payloads

Problem statement

- payload can cause significant and unpredictable changes to the robot’s dynamics
- characterizing the physical properties of every possible object in advance is infeasible in open-world environments
- rapid mid-flight adaptation to payloads that have a priori unknown physical properties remains an open problem

Proposed method

- online adaptation with meta-learning and model-based learning
- learning a predictive dynamics model parameterized by neural net, augmented with stochastic latent variables to represent unknown factors in the environment and task
- train on variety of physical conditions, use variational inference to estimate posterior over the latent variables
- at test time infer latent posterior, a controller uses the model to operate
- extend PETS which uses an ensemble of neural nets, each parameterizing a Gaussian on $s_{t+1}$ conditioned on $s_t$ and $a_t$, trained via maximum likelihood on transitions
- use MPC on the learnt dynamics model

Results

- average pixel tracking error, lowest for MBRL + meta + unkown latent, the second is MBRL + meta + known latent
- converge to different latent for different string length, as the latent value converges, the tracking error also reduces

Thoughts

- baselines seem to be weak, no adaptive control at all
- test trajectories seem to be simple, mostly locally linear, only few sharp turns
- does it work well on other task beside payload transportation ?
- can it adpated dynamic/non-stationary compoenents (e.g. anther agent) ?
