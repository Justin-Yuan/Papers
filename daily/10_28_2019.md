Capacity, Bandwidth, and Compositionality in Emergent Language Learning
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11424.pdf>

- most of emergent communication works focus on communicative bandwidth as primary importance
- explore how capacity of a neural net impacts its ability to learn a compositional language, there's a specific range of model capacity and channel bandwidth that induces compositoinal structure 
- evaluation metrics: precision, recall, residual entropy
- use a VAE with a discrete sequence bottleneck to model communication channel 
- use Straight-Through Gumbel-Softmax 
- 2 axes to determine capacity of the VAE: length of the latent sequence and number of parameters in encoder(decoder)

Bayesian Action Decoder for Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01458.pdf>

- use approximate Bayesian update to obtain a public belief that conditions on the actions taken by all agents in the environment 
-  public belief MDP, in which action space is all deterministic partial policies
- theory of mind reasoning, evaluated on cooperative partial-information game Hanabi 
- public belief is updated by sampling a set of possible private states from the public belief adn filtering for those states in which teammate chose the observed action
