<!-- ***************************************************** -->

first, learning a policy first on a simple morphology and then transferring to a harder one induces a natural curriculum for learning which provides richer rewards and learning signal; second, this allows us to use fewer samples from complex robots that are often expensive and time-consuming.

use hierarchical policies can help morphological transfer.

propose a top-down low-level alignment and a KL-regularized
high-level objective to accelerate transfer for hierarchical imitatio.

performance boost by morphological transfer on long-horizon navigation and manipulation tasks.
