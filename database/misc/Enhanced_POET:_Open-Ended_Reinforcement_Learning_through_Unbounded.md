generates and solves its own challenges, and allows solutions to goal-switch between challenges to avoid local optima

4 novelties 
- a domain-general measure of how meaningfully
novel new challenges are
-  an efficient heuristic for determining when agents should goal-switch from one problem to another
- a novel, more flexible way to encode environmental challenges
- a generic measure of the extent to which a system continues to exhibit open-ended innovation
