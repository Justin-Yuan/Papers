# VARIATIONAL INTRINSIC CONTROL
[link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07507.pdf)

## Intro 

dicovering the set of intrinsic options available to an agent by maximizing agent empowerment 

define options as policies with a temrination condition, which is independent of an agent's intentions 

likelihood measures the amount of information needed t odescribe data and empowerment measures the mutual information between action choices and final states 

what maximum likelihood is to unsupervised learning, is what mutual information between options and final states to unsupervised control 

empowerment over open loop options or closed loo options where actions are conditioned on state 

intrinsic reward as the variational lower bound to mutual information between options and final states 

explicit and implicit empowerment estimate
